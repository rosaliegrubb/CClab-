              <center><p class ="yellow">The local Leprechaun hunters of Ireland were on a special mission. It was the first rainbow of summer and they thought they were bound to find some Leprechauns. Instead, they discovered a new creature. 
                The new creature was then taken to scientist Rosalie Grubb's laboratory and research center to be researched. The creature, Doodle Bop, comes from the Doodlae family who all have one eye and are considered the happiest creatures in the world. Doodle Bop was discovered to be the happiest of them all. Doodle Bop is a friendly creature that adds color to anything it touches.</p></center>
